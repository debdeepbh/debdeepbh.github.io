title: Google drive client (gdrive) for command line
---

 A git-like command line tool called [drive](https://github.com/odeke-em/drive) has implemented all the features though auth2 secret key.
 Follow the instructions in its readme file, run
```
 	drive init ~/gdrive
```
 to start the service. In the command line, it will give you a link to visit to get a secret key which you enter in the command line.
 After that pull, push etc covers everything, Look at the Readme in the github for all information.

### Usage
 After `drive init`, go to the directory you initiated drive and then
```
 	drive pull 'directory name'
```
 pulls all the files, directories etc of 'directory' name.

 Similar to git, to push files to drive, you can create subdirectory inside the local gdrive structure. For example,
```
 	cd ~/grive
	mkdir new-folder
	cd new-folder
	cp ~/newfile ./
	drive push
```
 Be aware, if you do not have a copy of the remote files in the local location, drive push will delete the ones that are not present in the local path or in its children.
 
**Issue**: the authentication token expires occasionally, forcing you to follow some link, clicking on "Accept" and generate token, copy-paste it to the terminal window.
 
* Deleting files from drive:
 
 Either 
```
 	drive trash 'file to be trashed'
```
 Or, remember the name (with path) of the directory you want to delete. `rm -r` in local path. Then
```
  drive push 'path to the deleted file'
```
to delete it remotely.
 
* To empty trash 
```
 	drive emptytrash
```
* To permanently delete files without trashing it first (no need because I have infinite space in my institution-given drive) use
```
 	drive delete 'file to be deleted forever'
```
 
* To list files upto 1 depth inside some directory
```
 	drive list
```
 
* To list files upto 3 directory depth
```
 	drive list -depth 3
```
 
* You can use strings to look for while listing
```
 	drive list --matches mp4 pdf mp3
```
 
* To first sort by modTime, then largest-to-smallest and finally most number of saves inside the directory Photos
```
 	 drive list --sort modtime,size_r,version_r Photos
```
 
* To see stats of a directory recursively
```
 	drive stat -r 'directory name'
```
    or until depth 3
```
    	drive stat -depth 3 'directory'
```
 
* drive allows you to create an empty file or folder remotely Sample usage:
``` 
 $ drive new --folder flux
 $ drive new --mime-key doc bofx
 $ drive new --mime-key folder content
 $ drive new --mime-key presentation ProjectsPresentation
 $ drive new --mime-key sheet Hours2015Sept
 $ drive new --mime-key form taxForm2016 taxFormCounty
 $ drive new flux.txt oxen.pdf # Allow auto type resolution from the extension
```
* Show all information about your drive account
```
 	drive quota
```
  in more detail
```
 	drive about
```
 
* drive allows you to copy content remotely without having to explicitly download and then reupload.
```
 $ drive copy -r blobStore.py mnt flagging
 $ drive copy blobStore.py blobStoreDuplicated.py
```
 
* To perform a rename:
``` 
 $ drive rename url_test url_test_results
 $ drive rename openSrc/2015 2015-Contributions
```
 
* drive allows you to move content remotely between folders. To do so:
``` 
 $ drive move photos/2015 angles library archives/storage
```
 
* Command Aliases:
 drive supports a few aliases to make usage familiar to the utilities in your shell e.g:

     cp : copy
     ls : list
     mv : move
     rm : delete

 
 The `url` command prints out the url of a file. It allows you to specify multiple paths relative to root or even by id
``` 
 $ drive url Photos/2015/07/Releases intros/flux
```
