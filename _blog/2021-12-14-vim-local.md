If you are working in a linux environment without superuser privileges, you can set up vim (or nvim) and its plugins in the following way.

## vim

- Compile vim 8 from source with `python3` support
- Add path (`~/.local/bin/vim`) to local vim *before* the system vim path (`/usr/bin/vim`) in your `$PATH` variable

## nvim

- Download the executable binary
- Copy the content (`bin`, `lib`, `share`) of the extracted tar to `~/.local` so that it can be launched
- create `.config/nvim/init.vim` according to instructions and populate with appropriate lines
- run `nvim` and issue `:checkhealth` to see what does not work

### Using nvim as an alias for vim

In `.bashrc` add
```
alias vim=nvim
alias vimdiff="nvim -d"
```


### fixing Ultisnip python3 path

- Find python3 path with `which python3`
- Insert in `.vimrc` for `nvim` to specify the path of python3

```
let g:python3_host_prog = <full path from `which python3` output>
```

- Install `pynvim` using

```
pip3 install pynvim
```

- Run `:checkhealth` to see if there is still an issue.

### nodejs

- Download nodejs binary from [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

```
wget -c https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.13.0/node-v16.13.0-linux-x64.tar.xz
```

- extract and add the path of extracted location to `$PATH` in `~/.bashrc` and source
- check `node` command runs
- [unnecessary] install npm package `neovim` using ` npm install -g neovim `

### coc.nvim

- With `:PlugInstall` command you will get the error that the `Release` branch could not be found
- Go to the downloaded repository and (build and) install it with npm using

```
cd $HOME/.vim/plugged/coc.nvim
npm install
```

- Open `nvim` and check that coc is not showing any error
- Install language servers using `:CocInstall coc-pyright`

## ranger

I use ranger as a browser within vim via the plugin `francoiscabrol/ranger.vim`. To install ranger via pip,

```
pip3 install ranger-fm
```

## Issues

In the local environment, I have noticed the following issues.

- [ ] `nvim` takes a while to load
- [ ] the first insert mode in `nvim`  is very slow, after that it works well
- [x] ranger takes a while to start
	- turn off preview mode in `.config/ranger`
