## About 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Mathematics at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/).
My research involves employing novel theoretical and computational techniques coming from granular media and fracture to partial differential equation models for sea ice and its role in the climate system.
My faculty mentor is [Prof. Ken Golden](https://www.math.utah.edu/~golden/).

I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Mathematics at the [Louisiana State University](https://lsu.edu/), where
I investigated mechanical and network attributes of granular media as a part of a multidisciplinary university research initiative ([MURI](https://muri-granulardna.sites.caltech.edu/)) funded by the Army Research Office. 
Working primarily with [Prof. Robert Lipton](https://www.math.lsu.edu/~lipton/), I used high-performance computing to simulate and analyze bulk behavior of deformable and brittle granular media with peridynamics and discrete element method, as well as study the theoretical aspects of the associated models governed by nonlocal and nonlinear partial differential equations.

I received my Ph.D. in 2020 from the [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) under the guidance of [Prof. Frank Baginski](https://home.gwu.edu/~baginski/baginski.html). I studied low-regularity solutions to nonlinear dispersive equations, and Fourier-wavelet based signal deconvolution techniques.

<!-- My research interests include: -->
<!-- - High-performance computing to simulate and analyze the behavior of deformable and brittle granular media using peridynamics and discrete element method (DEM). -->
<!-- - Theoretical aspects of partial differential equations, in particular, nonlinear, nonlocal, and  dispersive equations primarily arising from continuum mechanics. -->
<!-- I study analysis and partial differential equations, in particular, nonlocal and nonlinear dispersive equations and their applications to continuum mechanics (classical and peridynamics) and granular media using high-performance computing.  -->
<!-- I am also interested in signal processing and machine learning.  -->
