## About 

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Louisiana State University](https://www.math.lsu.edu) working with [Prof. Robert Lipton](https://www.math.lsu.edu/~lipton/).

I study analysis and partial differential equations, in particular, nonlocal and nonlinear dispersive equations and their application to continuum mechanics (classical and peridynamics) and granular media using high-performance computing. I am also interested in signal processing and machine learning. See my [research page](/research/) for more details.
