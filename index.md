## About 

I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu/). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Mathematics in the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/) (2023 - 2024) and in [Louisiana State University](https://lsu.edu/) (2020 - 2023). I received my Ph.D. in 2020 from the [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/).

I work on mathematics of materials, in particular, on modeling fracture propagation in solids, and determining effective or homogenized properties of brittle granular media. I use high-performance computing and analysis of partial differential equations, especially of nonlocal and nonlinear types to solve emerging problems in the intersection of mathematics and material science.


<!-- My research interests include: -->
<!-- - High-performance computing to simulate and analyze the behavior of deformable and brittle granular media using peridynamics and discrete element method (DEM). -->
<!-- - Theoretical aspects of partial differential equations, in particular, nonlinear, nonlocal, and  dispersive equations primarily arising from continuum mechanics. -->
<!-- I study analysis and partial differential equations, in particular, nonlocal and nonlinear dispersive equations and their applications to continuum mechanics (classical and peridynamics) and granular media using high-performance computing.  -->
<!-- I am also interested in signal processing and machine learning.  -->
<!-- See my [research page](/research/) for more details. -->
