	<p><p>Add this to /boot/grub/grub.cfg in proper place with proper modification:</p>

<p>menuentry “Booting ISO” {
  insmod part_msdos
  insmod ntfs
  set root=’(hd0,msdos6)’
  loopback loop /new/liveDVDmint/ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso

  initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz
 }</p>

<p>The command “set root=’(hd0,msdos6)’” is equivalent to mounting the 6th partition of the zero-th hard disk as root (/). The command ‘insmod’ is still unknown to me but the 2nd line (insmod ntfs) tells that the partition type is ntfs. The path name after “loopback loop” tells the location of the iso.
 The Last 2 lines are enough to resurrect any linux system with a kernel image (in this case, vmlinuz) and a ramdisk (initrd). Define their relative locations and you are good to go. For different distro, the location and names of kernel and initrd are different. Website says, this piece of code is enough to boot a linux:
 menuentry “My custom Linux” {
 set root=(hd0,5)
 linux /boot/vmlinuz
 initrd /boot/initrd.img
 }
 This is NOT tested. If does not work, then Maybe the the options are needed to be changed.</p>

<p>For Windows, instead of kernel and initrd, use “chainloader +1” after defining root. A standard grub.cfg file is a good example.</p>

  <li>calendar.vim
 Since  I have pathogen to install vim plugins, cloning the repo to .vim/bundle/ installs it.
 Setting the google options in .vimrc, when I do :Ca inside vim, I cannot copy the link got google authentication. So I opened it in gvim and copied it. But in gvim, I cannot paste the code that I received from google. So I hand-typed it. Very annoying.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a quick possible solution:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open gvim</li>
  <li>Type :Ca</li>
  <li>Copy the link</li>
  <li>Paste in browser, proceed, get a code</li>
  <li>Edit the file .vim/bundle/calendar.vim/google/client.vim and navigate to the line: 
 let code = input(printf(calendar#message#get(‘access_url_input_code’),
 (This line is inside a function called access_token_async. The input code here is not able to access the bufferes “+, “* etc. So we manually supply the value of variable ‘code’. Make sure this modification does not stay for long)</li>
  <li>Modify the line to
 let code = ‘xxxx_your_code_goes_here_xxxx’</li>
  <li>Save the file.</li>
  <li>Open usual vim and run :Ca and it should work directly.</li>
  <li>Undo the changes in client.vim and save it back. This step is necessary because you don’t want to leave the code in a config file that is possibly uploaded to github. Make sure there are no git commits in the time interval between the two saves otherwise someone can look at the history of the file and retrieve it.</li>
</ol>

<p>See the calendar.vim/doc/calendar.txt for a complete help which I followed mostly.
 As a shortcut in awesomerc, add <code class="highlighter-rouge">xterm -e vim +:Ca</code> to open vim in a terminal with command :Ca and mapped it to Modkey+C</p>

 https://fixmynix.com/speed-up-firefox-with-ram-cache-and-tmpfs-linux/
 Note: Setting  browser.cache.disk.enable to false and setting browser.cache.memory.enable to true accelerates reloading recently loaded page elements. It comes with the variable browser.cache.memory.capacity which has to be created and specified as well. Eg: 409600. Reference: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.cache.memory.enable
 Note: This specified size is OUTSIDE the profile directory of firefox. The precess so far has not used any ramfs yet.</li>
</ol>

<p>N: Didn’t follow the first few http, ssl variable modifications. Starts from editing memory_cache variable.
 Main problem: the profile directory gets bigger and bigger and soon the tmpfs is full.
 Q: Can I sync while closing firefox instead of cronjob every 5 mins? Well, to save accidental crash, 5 mins seems better, still.

<p>To install the development dependencies, do
sudo apt-get build-dep xournal</p>

<p>Download the latest tar, extract it with
tar -xf xournal.<strong>.tar.gz
cd xournal.</strong></p>

<p>Details of patching can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/p/xournal/discussion/554377/thread/5d03da22/
Here is the summary:
Patch the source code with the download patch file
patch -p1 &lt; patchfile.patch</p>

<p>Note: if the patchfile is a tar file, extract and then -p1 should be change to -p2 or the required number of depth  of path.</p>

<p>Compile and install this modified source file, follow http://xournal.sourceforge.net/manual.html#installation</p>

<p>Summmary:</p>

<p>To install in the user directory (~/bin/), do:
./autogen.sh; ./configure –prefix=$HOME; make; make install; make home-desktop-install
The last step is to set mime-type etc.</p>

<p>To install it in the system, do with sudo:
./autogen.sh
make
(as root) make install
(as root) make desktop-install</p>

<p>So, far used the following patches: various improvements, linewidth-patch, vi-style scrolling</p>

<p>Caution: If you use the linewidth-patch, older versions of xournal will not be able to open the files saved by the patched version. Chances are, this patch will not end up in the official version in future, making all the files created with the patched version useless.</p>

<p>To log the input events, add the following line at the top of the file src/xo-callbacks.c:
#define INPUT_DEBUG 1
Then, compile and run from terminal to see all the input events popping up at the terminal.</p>

<p>Lesson Learned: IF you have a data with a variable name Category, and Catergoy can be either Grocery, Shopping or Travel, then first convert the variable into a factor using: data$Category &lt;- factor(data$Category)
 Then you can use levels(data$Category) to see a vector with only 3 vars. You can change the factor data$Category the way you change a vector.</p>

<p>The problem is to edit an entry in the data frame which is a category type. For example, if you want to change data[4,”Category”] to “hello”, you cannot change it using data[4,”Category”] &lt;- “hello” !!!
 Here is what to do:
 Change the type of Category varaible to character using:
 data$Category &lt;- as.character(data$Category)
 Edit the value:
 data[4,”Category”] &lt;- “hello”
 Change the variable type back to factor:

1: open up the boot partition on the micro sd with finder and in the file config.txt add dtoverlay=dwc2 to a line on the bottom and save it.
2: Create a new file called ssh using textedit and save it onto the boot partition. Use ‘get info’ to remove the extension on the file, and it should appear as an EXEC file. You can now eject the card and boot it on your RPi
3: Finally, open up the cmdline.txt. replace all text with this:</p>

<p>Plug in a <em>good</em> usb cable to the usb port, not the power in and then set up the retrying nm-applet attempt to connect to the wired network and fail repeatedly. At this point, you can connect to the pi using ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
If the repeated attemp to connect and fail message from nm-applet is bothersome, run dhcpcd enp7e0u1i7 (or whatever is the hardware name from ifconfig) on your laptop. Note: dhcpcd in not installed by default so install it using sudo apt-get install dhcpcd5</p>

Use wpa_passphrase <ssid_name>  to get the config file. Add it to /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

  <li>Find out name of the linux distribution
 cat /etc/*-release
 typically, os-release has all the info, including the pretty name.
 For the linux kernel version, cat /proc/version</li>
  <li>Determine which physical disk partition mounted on a directory
 For example, the / filesystem is installed on
  df /
 The directory /root is located in
  df /root
 Conversely, to see a list of all block devices and their mountpoints,
  lsblk</li>

<p>Folding Options (Should change in TODOsettings.vim file to make it permanent.)
set foldnestmax=10      | “deepest fold is 10 levels
set nofoldenable        | “dont fold by default

<h2 id="searching-help">Searching Help:</h2>
<p>** :set foldopen-=search  		to stop folds from opening on search, which is even better.
    :folddoopen s/old/new/ge 	to replace old with new in the lines which are not folded.</p>

<h2 id="warning">Warning:</h2>
<p>Smartindent is on, hence use <F2> before pasting into it.</F2></p>

<h2 id="want">Want:</h2>
<p>Not more than 2 stages of folding
 Search within the visible folded text
 Search within the invisible text inside folds
