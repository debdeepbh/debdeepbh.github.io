The linux command `du` (see `man du`) estimates file space usage. To see the the total size of the directory `directory` along with all its subdirectories, do

 `du -sh direcory/`

 Here, the `-s` parameter shows the total sum of all the files and subdirectories and `-h` shows the result in a human readable format.

 To show the size of all directory and subdirectory in the current location in ascending order, use
 
 ```du -sh ./* | sort -h```

 Here, `sort -h` sorts in the human-readable format.

 This method does not show you the hidden files or directories. So, here is one trick to do exactly that:

 ```du -sch .[!.]* * | sort -h```

The parameter `-c` produces a grand total. The shell pattern following the parameters make sure we are searching for all files including the ones that start with a dot. Whatever. There is a program specifically made for disk analyzing and cleanup purposes and it is awesome. It's called [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu).
 Just install it and run `ncdu` and feel the wind.
