title: Calendar.vim

[Calendar.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/calendar.vim) is an excellent plugin for vim to access google calendar from vim.

 If you use `pathogen` to install vim plugins (which I do), cloning the repo to `.vim/bundle/` installs it directly.

 Setting the google options in `.vimrc`, when I do `:Ca` inside vim, I cannot copy the link got google authentication. So I opened it in `gvim` and copied it. But in `gvim`, I cannot paste the code that I received from google. So I hand-typed it.

 Here is a quick possible solution:
 1. Open `gvim`
 2. Type `:Ca`
 3. Copy the link
 4. Paste in browser, proceed, get a code
 5. Edit the file `.vim/bundle/calendar.vim/google/client.vim` and navigate to the line:  

 ```
let code = input(printf(calendar#message#get('access_url_input_code'),
```  

 (This line is inside a function called access_token_async. The input code here is not able to access the bufferes `"+`, `"*` etc. So we manually supply the value of variable `code`. Make sure this modification does not stay for long)
 6. Modify the line to  
 ```
let code = 'xxxx_your_code_goes_here_xxxx'
```
 7. Save the file.
 8. Open usual vim and run :Ca and it should work directly.
 9. Undo the changes in client.vim and save it back. This step is necessary because you don't want to leave the code in a config file that is possibly uploaded to github. Make sure there are no git commits in the time interval between the two saves otherwise someone can look at the history of the file and retrieve it.
 
 See the `calendar.vim/doc/calendar.txt` for a complete help which I followed mostly.
 As a shortcut in awesomerc, add `xterm -e vim +:Ca` to open vim in a terminal with command `:Ca` and mapped it to `Modkey+C`
