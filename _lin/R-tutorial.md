### Installation
* Installing packages in R
```
  install.packages("ggplot2") 
```

### Usage
* Add "day of the week" column to your data with date:
 Let the data be tran and tran$Date is is date format (possibilities)
```
 tran$day <- weekdays(as.Date(tran$Date))
```
* Order your data by day of the week like this: (data is daily, day is DoW)
```
 daily$DoW <- factor(daily$DoW, levels= c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
 daily[order(daily$DoW), ]
```
* Plot frequency distribution of days of the week 
```
 barplot(table(tran$day))
```
* Create a sequence of weekdays, starting from today's day like this:
 Get today's date
```
 t <- Sys.Date()
```
* Create a sequence of 7 days by: adjust `t+const` to fix the starting day
```
 dayseq <- weekdays(seq.Date(t,t+6,by=1))
```
* Get the corresponding weekday value by
```
 weekdays(dayseq)
```
 or,
```
 daynames <- weekdays(dayseq, abbreviate=TRUE)
```

**Lesson Learned**: IF you have a data with a variable name Category, and Category can be either Grocery, Shopping or Travel, then first convert the variable into a factor using: 
```
data$Category <- factor(data$Category)
```
 Then you can use `levels(data$Category)` to see a vector with only 3 vars. You can change the factor data$Category the way you change a vector.
 The problem is to edit an entry in the data frame which is a category type. For example, if you want to change `data[4,"Category"]` to "hello", you cannot change it using `data[4,"Category"] <- "hello"` !!!
 Here is what to do:
 1. Change the type of Category variable to character using:
```
 data$Category <- as.character(data$Category)
```
 2. Edit the value:
```
 data[4,"Category"] <- "hello"
```
 3. Change the variable type back to factor:
```
 data$Category <- factor(data$Category)
```
  (It is very annoying.)
 

### qqplot2 help:

* A line plot :
```
 qplot(x=Date, y=Amount, data=tran, geom=c('point','line'), color=Category, alpha = I(0.7))
```

* The following prints number of times we did grocery, shopping etc w.r.t. date
```
 qplot(factor(timeS), data=tran, geom="bar", fill=factor(Category))
```

* The following prints two side by side maps for each user. Each picture contains the count of grocer, Shopping and travel represented by different colors. The x-axis is time span.
```
 ggplot(tran, aes(timeS, fill=Category)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~ User) 
```

A slight invariant:

```
 ggplot(tran, aes(timeS, fill=User)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~ Category)
```
 `stat='identity'` is the option that lets you plot y vs x instead of the defualt statistics count.

* Plot amount vs date/timeS, stacked with category
```
 ggplot(tran) + geom_bar(aes(timeS, Amount, fill=Category), stat='identity')
```

* With a separate user:
```
 ggplot(tran) + geom_bar(aes(timeS, Amount, fill=Category), stat='identity') + facet_wrap(~ User)
```
 
* Seperate picture by category, both users in the same picture, 2rows of pictures
```
 ggplot(tran) + geom_bar(aes(x=timeS, y=Amount, fill=User), stat='identity') + facet_wrap(~ Category, nrow = 2)
```
 
* Facet_wrat w.r.t User of all categories with a greyscale of total amount of both users in the background
```
 ggplot(tran) + geom_bar(aes(timeS, Amount, fill=Category), stat='identity') + geom_bar(data=transform(tran, User=NULL), aes(x=timeS, y=Amount), stat='identity', alpha=I(0.2)) + facet_wrap(~User)
```

* To have a picture in the background of every facet, we need to create a facet without the facet variable. For example, in the previous case, transform(tran, User=NULL) gives you a data without the facet variable ~User. We plot a bar geometry of this data.
 
* Alternate representation with Category and User interchanged
```
  ggplot(tran) + geom_bar(aes(timeS, Amount, fill=User), stat='identity') + geom_bar(data=transform(tran, Category=NULL), aes(x=timeS, y=Amount), stat='identity', alpha=I(0.2)) + facet_wrap(~Category)
```
 In this context, manysum is nothing but
```
 ggplot(tran) + geom_bar(aes(timeS, Amount, fill=User), stat='identity')
```
