title: Writing a manpage
---

 Manpages are written in something called *troff markdown language*.

 Create a file starting with the following lines and open with
```
 	man -l filename.
```

 Body of the manpage:

 |.Dd | date-of-modification
 |.Dt | name-of-the-article 7 (7 for miscellaneous manual. see man man for explanation)
 |.Sh | NAME
 |.Nm | name of the article
 |.Nd | description of the article
 
 Caution:
     *   Keep codes within a `.Bd -literal ... .Ed` block.
     *   Do NOT write Em anywhere in your text, it will vanish. Write `\&Em`
         instead.

Frequently used macros

| .Sh | New Section
| .Ss | New subsection
| .Bl | begin list. It can take the following parameters: `-bullet, -item, -enum, -tag, -hang` etc.
| .It | items inside `.Bl` and `.El`
| .El | end list
| .Pa | path for a filename
| .Bd | begin a display block, It takes a few parameters, most importantly -literal which is useful for source codes, spaced and tabbed text.
| .Dl | literal text of one line
| .Ed | end display block one line of literal text
| \fB | begins bold
| \fI | begins Italian
| \fR | ends bold and/or Italian
| .Em | emphasize (a line of bold, similar to `\fB ... \fR`). If using inside an item of list, use without the dot, e.g.  `.It Em tagname`

  escape chars  `\e` generates a `\`, `\&` replaces at the beginning of a sentence, but doesn't generate a `.`.

  Type    |    Output
  \e      |      \
  \efB    |      \fB
  \&.     |      .
  \&Em    |      Em

See the BSD manpage for mdoc online. (Note: mdoc for Arch is something else)

There is a way to include a custom file to a man database.
