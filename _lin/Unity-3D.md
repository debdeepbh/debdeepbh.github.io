title: Unity 3D
---
This method is for Arch linux mainly.

* Install `linpng12` from AUR.
 
* Install unity 3d from AUR. Note: The package build is 11GB  after *makepkg -s` and creates a `.sh` file and a directory. Instead of `pacman -U`, use the generated install script as there will be no `.xi` file to install. This is also an advantage since these files can be moved to another partition and launched. These are 3GB long.
 
### Usage

 Lessons:
 A "is Trigger" object with a "Rigid body" component is a "Dynamic collider" and uses more resources.
 A "is Trigger" object without"Rigid body" component is a "Static  collider" is ideal. Setting "kinemetic" field will give you desired result.
