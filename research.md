## Research

My area of interest is Applied Mathematics in general. Currently I am interested in nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, and signal processing.

My advisors are [Prof. Frank Baginski](https://home.gwu.edu/~baginski/baginski.html) and [Prof. Svetlana Roudenko](https://case.fiu.edu/about/directory/people/svetlana-roudenko.html).
